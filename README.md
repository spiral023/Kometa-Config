# My personal Kometa Configuration File

Kometa uses a YAML configuration file (https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/config/overview/) to set its behavior and define connection details for Plex Media Server, Radarr, Sonarr, and other third-party services. By default, Kometa looks for the config file at `/config/config.yml`. A template configuration file is available at https://github.com/Kometa-Team/Kometa/blob/master/config/config.yml.template. You should start with this and slowly add changes.
